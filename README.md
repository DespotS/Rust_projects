# University Rust Projects

Welcome to the repository for my university projects developed using the Rust programming language! This collection showcases various assignments, experiments, and applications created as part of my coursework.

## **Contents**

- `guessing_game`: A simple number guessing game built with Rust.
- `project_1`: [Description of this project, e.g., a CLI tool or a web application].
- Additional folders will be added as new projects are completed.
